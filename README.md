# attendance-autofill

In the wake of the coronavirus school closings, the school decided to have "online school" where teachers would give out assignments everyday. They also made you fill out a Google Form every morning for attendance which you had to fill out to show that you were "in class." This project fills out that form for you so you can sleep in without worrying about it. Set a cronjob to run every morning after 7:20 a.m.
